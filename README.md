Linear Regression
In this session, you will learn about the generic steps required to build a simple linear regression model.
You will first read and visualise the data set. 
Next, you will split the data set into train and test sets.
You will then build the model on the training data and draw inferences.
We have used the data set and example from the ISLR book.
You will use the advertising dataset given in ISLR and analyse the relationship between ‘TV advertising’ and ‘Sales’ using a simple linear regression model.
You will learn to make a linear model using two different libraries – statsmodels and SKLearn. 
Before moving on to the Python code, we need to address an important aspect of linear regression: the assumptions of linear regression.
While building a linear model, you assume that the target variable and the input variables are linearly dependent
note:You are making inferences on the ‘population’ using a ‘sample’. The assumption that variables are linearly dependent is not enough to generalise the results you obtain on a sample to the population, which is much larger in size than the sample. Thus, you need to have certain assumptions in place in order to make inferences.
